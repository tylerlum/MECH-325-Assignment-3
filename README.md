Safety Analysis of Bolts on Motor Mount

The repository includes:

1. MATLAB files to analyze the safety of a 1hp motor mount system with four SAE grade-1 steel bolts. This includes bolt geometry analysis, bolt/member stiffness calculations, and force/stress analysis. We ensured that we had reasonable factors of safety for tensile, shear, and bearing stresses on the bolt and members.

2. Diagrams showing our analysis visually to better understand the MATLAB files
